Difficult images due to e.g. several persons: the index reported below is index according to train dataframe, get the images for visualization using `train.loc[index].img`

- 28: 3 faces, HAAR detects fragment of the wall / SOLVED
- 29: 2 faces, / SOLVED
- 30: 2 faces, but same person (just a close-up) / SOLVED? (separated in 2 different ones)

- 34: 3 faces, class label 1 but lookalike present / SOLVED
- 39: 2 faces / SOLVED
