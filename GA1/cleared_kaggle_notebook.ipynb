Both HAAR and MTCNN failed on training image with index 49, shown below. The detectors have a more confidence detection due to Kristen Stewart. We can exploit the knowledge from the class label, and use a template of Jesse to force our detector to detect Jesse's face instead by relying on a similarity score. Note that we can also prevent this issue by cropping the image such that only the person we wish to detect is in the image, as we did in the beginning of our preprocessing. However, it is clear that the method provided by DeepFace is more robust, and is easily scalable towards larger datasets. "

For instance, the `opencv` detector is simply the HAAR cascade detector we discussed earlier. Also, the MTCNN detector is implemented here. A more state-of-the-art detector based on deep learning is also implemented and selected in the end, known as [RetinaFace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00641.pdf).\n",

These last ones are also what it is used to align the faces to desired poses. It has been chosen because it achieves higher accuracy and robustness in changing conditions and poses while being only slightly slower in comparison to HAAR and MTCNN."

Selecting a value of 10 for `nFeatures` allows our SIFT extractor to limit keypoints to discriminative features such as the contours of the eyes, nose, mouth. The `sigma` parameter represents the sigma of the Gaussian that is applied to the image. Since our images have a weak quality and an additional bilateral filter is applied to each image before extracting features, we reduce this number.\n",

    "In this section we observed that the handcrafted SIFT features are discriminative. From both the visualized matching keypoints and the TSNE plot we observe that SIFT effectively separates features of two different people, namely Jesse Eisenberg and Mila Kunis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regard to robustness, the handcrafted features perform less effectively in this domain. While the SIFT extractor generally extracts a few features effectively (such as the eye and nostril features in the first image of Jesse Eisenberg), only a few 'good' features are extracted for each image. A more robust system would extract features from the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears for each image regardless of the image conditions. The system can be made more robust by improving the preprocessing of images before extracting features. While the SIFT extractor applies a guassian to images before grabbing features, additional steps such as normalizing contrast and brightness could improve the definition of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the previous grabbing task in the individual assignment, the SIFT extractor applied in facial recognition must be more local. What is meant by this is that distinguishing features from person to person is a more difficult task than object recognition seen in the previous assignment. Because of this the SIFT extractor needs to be well tuned to distinguish slight the intricacies of facial features."

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The second method to extract features out of image data that we explore is principal component analysis. __Principal Component Analysis__ (PCA) is a technique used to extract highly variant components (set of points) from data. In our case, we will apply it to faces in order to extract those components that make up the variability of the faces. Ideally, we would discretize or isolate components containing facial features that can be later used to discriminate the faces in our dataset. Most of the work in applying this method relies in picking informative components and the least amount of background noise as well as aligning the faces to a reference point to reduce variance generated only based on the location of the face.\n",
    "\n",
    "For PCA, we first convert each image in our training set into a one-dimensional array by flattening the images. If color images are used, we flatten each color channel and concatenate them. For simplicity, we discuss the case of performing PCA on square grasycale images, each having the same size $K\\times K$ (with, by default, $224\\times 224$ for our training set). After flattening, we hence have a matrix $M$, often called the __data matrix__ of size $Z \\times K^2$, with $Z$ the number of training examples. The columns (flattened pixels) then represent random variables, while the rows indicate different samples of those random variables. In our case, the matrix hence has size $80 \\times 10 \\ 000$. Given this data matrix, we zero-mean the dataset. That is, we compute the mean of each column and subtract it from all training examples. The reason behind centering the data is that the covariance matrix is sensitive to the mean of the data: without centering, the covariance matrix will reflect the location of the mean of the data (the bias in the training data) as well as its variability, which makes for a worse PCA performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are then two ways to proceed with PCA. The first option is to compute the covariance matrix of this data matrix $M$. This will give a covariance matrix $C$ of size $K^2 \\times K^2$, of which we compute the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD). The principal components are then determined by the largest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix, since they indicate the directions of highest variance. By keeping $q$ principal components, we compute a projection matrix of size $q \\times K^2$ which stores the corresponding eigenvectors as columns. Given a flattened image $x$ with shape $K^2 \\times 1$, we can compute a lower-dimensional representation $z = W\\cdot x$, and $z$ is often referred to as the __feature vector__. The time complexity of computing the EVD on a $n\\times n$ matrix is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other approach is to use **singular value decomposition** (SVD). It generalizes the concept of eigenvalue decomposition, which can only be applied to square matrices, to matrices of any shape. Similar to the EVD case, here we keep the $q$ largest singular values and their corresponding vectors as the principal components. The time complexity of computing the SVD on a $m\\times n$ matrix is $\\mathcal{O}\\left( \\text{min}\\left( mn^2, m^2 n \\right) \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the matrix of interest has shape $80 \\times 10 \\ 000$. Due to this dimensionality, computing the SVD of this matrix is much more efficient than the EVD. During our experiments, we noted that computing the EVD on the covariance matrix could easily take more than 10 minutes, whereas the SVD takes only a few seconds. We did not see any significant advantage for the EVD in terms of performance. As such, we decided to stick to the SVD in this implementation. Our implementation makes use of scikit-learn's PCA, which in turn calls numpy's SVD optimised function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge with PCA is choosing the number of principal components. One way to choose this value is by looking at the eigenvalues/singular values $\\lambda_i$, $i = 1, ..., N$ of the data matrix, ordered in decreasing magnitude. (For EVD, $N$ equals $K^2$, while for SVD, $N$ equals $Z$). We can then decide the number of principal components $q$ by requiring that these components explain a certain percentage $p$ of the variance in the dataset, *i.e.* choose $q$ such that\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}  \n",
    "    \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^q \\lambda_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\lambda_i} \\geq p \\, .\n",
    "\\end{equation*}  \n",
    "Another approach could be to investigate the average reconstruction loss on the training images. In the end, the number of principal components is another hyperparameter of the classifier, and one needs to carefully tune this hyperparameter, such as via a knee plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, although already mentioned briefly, it is worth explaining the decision behind doing the mean subtraction. It is a common preprocessing step in PCA, since it improves the resulting covariance matrix, due to its sensitivity to the mean of the data. Commonalities on every face are not informative, so with a minimum information loss we can focus on the variations around the mean. In addition to that, interpreting the meaning of the principal components gets facilitated, since they get aligned with the directions of maximum variation. At the same time, although talking about PCA on square grayscale images where it might not be that powerful, mean subtraction can remove some bias due to lighting as it would subtract the mean pixel intensity making it easier to focus on the relevant variations.f"

    "We can use this information to choose the number of principal components to keep for the classifier later on. For instance, we can consider the \"gain\" in RMSD when we increase the number of principal components to keep. Below, we plot for each value of $q$ the difference between the RMSD value with $q$ components and $q+1$ components. Together with the previous plot, we see that we have the best results for $q=40$ or $q=50$, so it would make sense to try different values of $q$ in the classification pipeline later on to tune this hyperparameter. We expect that, while the reconstruction loss goes steadily down for increasing number of principal components, having simpler features can be beneficial for the classifiers."

In a face-feature plot, we plot the different faces of the training set at locations that are determined by their features obtained from the PCA projection. For visualization purposes, we therefore restrict ourselves to $q = 2$, such that there are only two eigenfaces of interest. Applying the PCA projection on each image then gives us a 2D representation of the faces, which determine the location in the grid where we plot each image. "

One of the most critical choices that has to be made is the number of principal components, and for that, the **root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)** was used. This measure gives us a tool to calculate for every iteration on the number of principal components the *loss* of the reconstruction. For us, based on that procedure, the clear result was to avoid any values above 40, since there was no much information gained with higher numbers. In that way, the dimensionality of the feature space gets reduced while still being pretty informative.\n",

Just before this discussion the face-feature plot is shown, and while the lookalikes are distributed over the whole PCA space, it is a normal behaviour since we are just using 2 principal components. The other classes, on the other hand, are clearly separated between them. Apart from that, another representative plot can be seen in the projection of the reconstructions of a face as the number of principal components increases."

    "We begin with an SVM classifier based on the PCA features discussed above. An SVM, or Support Vector Machine, is a classifier that maximizes the distance between two classes when they are linearly separable. When data is not linearly separable, a kernel is applied to transform the data in such a way that a linear decision boundary can still be found. Our aim is that with the SIFT and PCA features, we can find a linear separation between the features of Jesse Eisenberg and Mila Kunis. For that purpose, we use a radial basis function (RBF) kernel (also known as Gaussian kernel) below.\n",

That is, we use a fully-connected (dense) **feedforward multilayer perceptron** (MLP), which takes our handcrafted features as input features, and propagates them through a few hidden layers to compute an output. In our case, the output will consist of three nodes that represent the probabilities that a given feature representation corresponds to the given classes 0, 1, 2. We will demonstrate the inner workings of neural networks using the PyTorch library. For our purpose, one can choose whether to convert the targets, *i.e.* the class labels, to 3D vectors for this purpose using the auxiliary function defined below, although PyTorch is able to handle both representations."

    "In summary we contributed the following: \n",
    "* We enhanced and augmented the training dataset by manually cropping poorly cropped images or images that showed the wrong person.\n",
    "* We experimented with three preprocessing strategies, namely HAAR, MTCNN, and RetinaFace. Our final pipeline uses the RetinaFace preprocessing images because it combines face detection, landmark localization and face bounding box regression that result in the best accuracy in preprocessing faces.\n",
    "* We implemented SIFT to extract handcrafted features that are invariant to scale. We visualize these features and demonstrate how they are matched for facial recognition.\n",
    "* We implemented PCA to extract features and demonstrate how we can reconstruct an image with varying number of principal components.\n",
    "* We implemented various classification methods, namely SVM, RandomForest, and a FeedForwardNet on both SIFT and PCA features. We discover that the PCA features are more robust with a best average f1-score of .86. This may be due to the fact that the SIFT method extracts fewer good features, and thus may result in more variability during classification.\n",
    "* We also enhance our classifiers with cross validation and an ensemble method to classify data based on both SIFT and PCA features. These methods are especially important to tackle overfitting seen with such a small training dataset.\n",
    "* We used transfer learning to employ state of the art VGG Face Feature Extraction with results in 0.91 accuracy on the test data in the Kaggle competition."
